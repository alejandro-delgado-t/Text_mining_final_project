But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left

On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit

Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong

The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)

Conversation and Hennessy

When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long

Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""

I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""

And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone

Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown

Oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire

I gotta let my spirit be free

And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken a few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away (When love)
And you can't help who you love (Just can't help who you love)
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause
[Chorus]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven) (Ooh, 'cause)

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid)
Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand)
It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody)
I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm)
Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm)
Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
Just follow me, I'll get you there
[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world,
feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse,
forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe",https://genius.com/eminem-not-afraid-lyrics,"['Matthew Burnett', 'Boi-1da', 'Jordan Evans', 'Eminem']","['Boi-1da', 'Luis Resto', 'Eminem', 'Matthew Burnett', 'Jordan Evans']",,"April 29, 2010","['Soundtrack', 'Detroit Rap', 'In English', 'Pop Rap', 'Rap', 'Hardcore Rap', 'Anthem', 'Hip-Hop', 'USA', 'Midwest Rap', 'Pop']",4,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2010-04

Deep in my soul that love never lasts

To make it alone or keep a straight face

To myself that I'm content with loneliness

I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'

There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!

Lacked luster 'cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy

Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit; people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!

In this very moment, I slay Goliath with a sling

Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy

If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher

Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away
[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair

Never felt so high

We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room

But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I want to feel that way again

We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad because you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

Be us against the world

I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And I thought you were innocent

Bailing some hay and stackin' it all up

To your place around eight o'clock

Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

Aren't you somethin' to admire?

The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
(Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)

That we're making
Two reflections into one

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled

And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay

my uncle was,
and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God,
aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

I'm startin' to think it ain't for e'rybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it
[Chorus: Tiara Thomas & Wale]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (To you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck (Let's get it)

Bad girls ain't no good
And the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't 'bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (Bad, no) in the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya, but to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (Bad, no)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed, but the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea

Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless

And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July

I've closed enough windows

May your past be the sound

I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on

'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on

And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping

Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress

Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping

I tell the truth like, ""Father, forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog,"" that shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back is that it just keep comin' back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after 3
Man, this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The fee not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it

I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'

When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out

'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are

You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)

I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society

But I only know that I remembered (Eh, eh)
How I did it to you that time (Oh, oh)
And I can't continue to be alone (Hehe)
But I know that I threw you out
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out (Yeh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ozuna]
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell I sent you … and I sent you
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out
Yeh, yeh, mami

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny]
Baby life is a cycle (Wuh)
And if doesn't work, I don't recycle
So move from my life
If I give it to you it’'s to remember a TBT, yeh
I got tired of your liеs
There’'s another girl who likеs me (Yeh)
Everything has its end, everything expires (Yeh)
You’'re the past and the past never returns
Go to hell (Wuh)
My body doesn’'t need you
What it's asking for is a dirty dance in the Placita
I don’'t think our story will repeat
Go ahead, turn on a phillie and leave one ready for now, yeh eh
I hate to know that I trusted in you again
I hate all the ""I Love You's"" that I texted a thousand times
Baby, better than you I have like 10
Our love drove in a Bugatti and you stayed on foot, I threw you out

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Bunny, Darell]
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell you left … and you left
And I nailed your friend, I nailed her
Fuck you, bitch (Wuh)

Baby I threw you out
And ever since I threw you out, the girls come in three's (That's right)
If you don't believe me, just ask (Baby)
That I no longer have stress
To complete the line, they're express
What a mess how your world went backwards
I messed with her
That I fell in love the day I tasted her
I don't think I'm going back and giving it to you
Mami, because I cancelled your service
If I do not answer
The problem is going to hit rock bottom
Mami breathe deeply, while I hide it (That's right)
With you I'm obligated to wear a condom today
But I'm posting in mid-court, baby, like Rondo
I give you a funeral (That's right)
I know that over time the wound heals (By law)
But the truth is that you’'re not at my level
I sweat to God even though you shouldn't swear to God (Ratatata)

You broke my heart (You broke my heart) (Woo)
Without meaning and without reason (Without meaning and without reason) (Ah)
But I have a new ass who gives me a lot of affection and fucks me real good (Real good)
I'm not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
And I don't want to know about you
And to hell I sent you … I'm going to go drink today (Going to do drink)

Out of my life, I threw you out
And I know you're not just anybody
I’'ll spend my entire life
Asking where did it go
But your friend texts me
Every time she desires me
She takes a photo with me
And tells me it's for you to see it
I light up to see if I forget
Your name, your kisses, your body, your moans
We would do it in the car, you would scream in my ear
You left far from here without an explanation
You saw my movie and gave me your back
Now you want to know what I think of you
I feel good because you're not here
The same way you came, you can leave (You can leave)
I’'m not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
To hell I sent you …I sent you
I got you out of my life …I got you out
Baby, I threw you out

I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss it when you would rub your skin on me
I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss your morning calls
Asking me to give it to you rough in bed and make you my woman
I’'m taking advantage of this remix with Ozu to send you to hell also
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I'm leaving with the girls who want to play
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I’m leaving with the girls who want to play

I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit

The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now

There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground

I guess that's why they call it God's country

Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'

The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We take a break and break bread on Sunday

To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head

I ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

Если я зову тебя деткой, то ты детка на день
Или детка на ночь, ты не моя жена
Она хочет убийцу, чтобы трахаться всю ночь
Я хочу трахаться с тати, соси мне всю ночь

Я богатый, но я катаюсь, у меня мало экзотики, я должен вылететь и получить немного
Ничего не видел, все эти деньги на мне, сотня пачек в сумке, это медовая булочка
Baby OG, я бегал по этим улицам, получил игру из Lashawn
Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас
Я и Cash плюс кто бы то ни был, я иду снова
У получил ниггеров на улице, не побьёшь меня
Я получил индустрию, пытаешься быть мной
Я просто Рэй Чарльз, они не могут увидеть меня
Я в Rolls-Royce с RiRi

[Куплет 3: DaBaby & Pop Smoke]
Как вор в ночи (Вор)
Я подъехал, дал ей D на ночь (Ах-хах)
Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо

Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

Burning going down, burning going down

Mmm

Pensarás que estoy loca
Por la forma en que he lo estado deseando
Si lo pongo bien claro
Solo dame bebés
Entonces, ¿qué harás esta noche?
Más vale que digas: ""Haciéndolo bien contigo"" (Sí)
Mirando películas, pero no veremos nada esta noche (Sí)

[Pre-Coro]
No quiero mantenerte despierto (Despierto)
Pero muéstrame, ¿puedes mantenerlo erecto? (Erecto)
Porque luеgo tendré que mantenеrte despierto
Mierda, quizá te mantendré despierto, chico
He estado tomando café (He estado tomando café, café)
Y he estado comiendo sanamente (Y he estado comiendo sanamente, sanamente)
Sabes que lo mantendré rechinante (Sabes que lo mantengo rechinante)
Ahorrando mi energía (Sí, sí, ahorrando mi energía)

[Coro]
¿Puedes quedarte despierto toda la noche?
Cógeme hasta la madrugada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco (Sí, sí, sí, sí)
¿Puedes quedarte despierto toda la noche?
Cógeme hasta la madrugada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco (Sí, sí, sí, sí)

[Verso 2: Doja Cat y Ariana Grande]
¿Podemos estar despiertos toda la noche? A la mierda el jet lag
Trae tu buen culo y bolsa de viaje
Suma los números o ponte atrás de ellos
Reprodúcelo y rebobínalo, escucha, encontrarás eso
Quiero ese seis nueve sin el Tekashi
Y quiero tu cuerpo y lo hago obvio
Despierta a los vecinos, tenemos audiencia
Escuchan los aplausos, pero no aplaudimos
Seis en punto, lo estoy aplastando
Llegan las siete, ahora lo quiere
Dieron las ocho, dijimos: ""A la mierda""
Olvida tu chica, finge que soy ella
Ven a hacer al gato ronronear, a hacer que me duela la espalda, ey
Haciendo ese chorro, lluvia, ducha y rocío
Ahora eso es perfecto, bebé, no dormimos lo suficiente
Pero te mantendré despierto, si puedes seguir así (bebé)

¿Puedes quedarte despierto toda la noche?
Cógeme hasta la madrugada

[Verso 3: Megan Thee Stallion]
Te arrullaré como un bebé
Pero sabes que te mantendré despierto
Bienvenido a mi canal y hoy te enseñaré algo (Enseñarte algo)
Puedo hacerlo explotar, piernas arriba como el cancán
Despierta a los vecinos, que suene como si la banda estuviera tocando
Perra, déjame ponerme linda (Sí)
Está a punto de llegar (Está a punto de llegar)
He estado en la ducha durante una hora entera
Él actuará como un perro, entonces él obtendrá el gatito calvo
¿Netflix o Hulu? Bebé, tú eliges
Estoy despierta como Starbucks, tres bombeadas, ooh
Este coño es bueno para tu salud, llámalo superalimento
Cuando estoy sola hago manualidades como YouTube
Mala, mala perra, todos los chicos quieren azotarme (azotarme)
Lo dejé en visto, la novia tiene que agradecerme (agradecerme)
Hacer que esté de puntitas, bailarina, sin tutú
Bebé, soy la mejor, yo no sé que hace el resto (Ayy, ayy, ayy, sí)
Sumérgete en el agua como una isla privada
Treinta y cuatro, treinta y cinco, podemos sesenta y nueve-arlo
Y he sido una chica mala, pero este coño en la lista buena (buena lista)
Espero que no estés cansado, no nos detendremos hasta que termine (Ayy, ayy, ayy, sí)

In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big goon shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sensе
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobе, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on

I'm the strong one,
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains,
I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum,
I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back, what breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer

""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""

Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away

I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance

Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties

Todas outras garotas fazеm demais, mas essa garota é de boa
Não, eu vou resolver essa situação, eu vou lá falar ''oi''

De onde você vem? Woah (Mhmm)
Porque você não quer conversar? Woah (Mhmm)
Aí eu começo a senti-la bum-bum, woah (Mhmm)
Mas ela só me da um pouco, pouco, woah
Eu sei dizer para ela passar aquele, aquele (Mhmm)
Mas ela se sente insegura, woah
Porque seus amigos te mastigam tipo chiclete, woah (Mhmm)
Te mastigam tipo chiclete, oh-woah

Y sé que vales la pena
No puedo alejarme, oh

And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

He live in the bottle, that's the way it is

The stars on the ceiling, stellar has already left
But you know that this night you're for me
Come, climb on top of me, send me your location, I'll pick you up

So the baby dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yestеrday
She wants me to play music for her
So thе babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

[Verse 1: Yng Lvcas]
She has not yet forgotten how we spent time
We went to the club and the two of us danced close together
Like dogs close together, kisses and a couple drinks
She stayed by my side and said, ""I think I fell in love""
She smokes, she drinks
She's a little devil, small, but spicy
I love it when she rubs it against my pants
She loves it, you can see it in her face, she enjoys it

[Bridge: Peso Pluma]
She's got a boyfriend and doesn't behave
She tells me, ""Chill, 'cause the relationship is broken""
Our bodies crash and crash
Our mouths get together, the leggings choke her

And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday you were moving very well, very well
She got covered in the smell of Chanel
We're a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
She's hot and has a pretty face
You play music for her, and she gets horny by herself
For the party, she never holds back
A couple friends, she completes the crew
But you, mama, you know, I like you a lot
Crazy, come here, get close all the way back
You and me will go on a fleeting journey
Interstellar, eat you out
We will both smoke marijuana
In my room, on my rooftop and on my bed
Bae, I think you're getting a call, answer tomorrow
Don't let the fire die
On the AMG, listening to ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Burning poison that got me flying, mami
A little kiss to the Barbie, so she dances close
Slanty eyes like Puki from Taiwan, -an
Like Puki from Taiwan
Like Puki from Taiwan
I eat that pussy whenever I want, mami, mami

With a tear in her blood-stained shirt

The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry

How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro
Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto
Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Ah
¿Y qué?

And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow

To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy

And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down

Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?

How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

Remember every moment on the nights with you

And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains

And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
